# Getting started
:octicons-info-24: Informative

Odak (pronounced "O-dac") is the fundamental library for scientific computing in optical sciences, computer graphics, and visual perception.
We designed this page to help first-time users, new contributors, and existing users understand where to go within this documentation when they need help with certain aspects of Odak.
If you think you need a refresher or are a beginner willing to learn more about light and computation, we created an entire course named `Computational Light` for you to get to pace with the computational aspects of light.
